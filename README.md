Fourier Epicycles Drawing

Draw a picture as a closed line on the right canvas, choose the number of circles you want to use, and click Start to generate the epicycles animation.

How it works (a bit of theory):

The coordinates of the points you draw are treated as complex numbers. The program finds a continuous function that connects these points using epicycles.

If you choose fewer circles than the number of points, the resulting drawing won’t be a perfect replica, because each circle is responsible for guiding the function toward a corresponding point. Some points are effectively skipped.

If you use enough circles, the resulting picture still looks very similar to your original drawing — sometimes even smoother than your initial sketch!

Usage:

1. Draw a picture on the right canvas.

2. Set the number of circles using the slider.

3. Click Start to watch the epicycles animate your drawing.

4. Click Reset to try again.

Have fun experimenting with different drawings and numbers of circles!
